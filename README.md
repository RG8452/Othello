# Othello
This is a short Java game intended to be a simple JFrame / JPanel implementation of the game Othello. I programmed this with my friend Jason Oliphant, who helped with lots of the logic after the graphics had been set up. There isn't too much to say about this game; it follows the rules of Othello and uses MouseListener to handle user input while AWT does graphics.
